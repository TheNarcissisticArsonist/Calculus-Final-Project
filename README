Hotkeys:
1:          Method 1, generate one prime number
2:          Method 1, generate ___ prime numbers
3:          Method 1, generate up to ___ prime numbers
[control]:  Switches to Method 2
[shift]:    Switches to Method 3
r:          Reset prime generation
R:          Reset table
s:          Toggle sort options visibility
a:          Run advanced test
n:          Sort table by test number
m:          Sort table by method
t:          Sort table by time
u:          Reset table sorting

Most boxes on the page are clickable buttons,
accomplishing similar or even the same thing as hotkeys.
Sometimes, they can do stuff the hotkeys can't.

For the custom test, the format is
a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h.i.j.k.l.m.n.o.p.q where...
a is 1 or 0, whether to reset the table before running the test
b is 1 or 0, whether to reset the prime generation after running the test
c is the number of m11 tests to run
d is the number of m12 tests to run
e is how high the m12 tests will run
f is the number of m13 tests to run
g is how high the m13 tests will run
h is the number of m21 tests to run
i is the number of m22 tests to run
j is how high the m22 tests will run
k is the number of m23 tests to run
l is how high the m23 tests will run
m is the number of m31 tests to run
n is the number of m32 tests to run
o is how high the m32 tests will run
p is the number of m33 tests to run
q is how high the m33 tests will run
For example, the input 1.1.0.0.0.5.500.0.0.0.5.500.0.0.0.5.500 would run 5 tests to 500 of m13, m23, and m33.
